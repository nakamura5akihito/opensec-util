# opensec-util
Utility components for Opensec framework
Opensec UTIL is a collection of reusable Java components. 
The main parts are:
* Object-XML mapping
* Object-Database mapping

[Castor](http://castor.codehaus.org/) 
and [Morphia](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia)
are utilized for implementing these functions. 
Castor is an open source data binding framework for Java, and 
the above functions are the intrinsic value of Castor. 
Opensec UTIL simplifies APIs for these functions and 
appends a supplementary framework of data search in the object-oriented manner.

Since version 3.5.0 of the former project [SIX UTIL], 
Object-NoSQL mapping utility classes are provided. 
[Morphia](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia) is used for the Object-MongoDB mapping.
